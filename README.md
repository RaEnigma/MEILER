# MEILER
MEI Lilypond Edition Repository

For now the mei2ly.xsl supports main (music) elements from MEI and works for checking encoding errors.
It uses XSLT 2.0. Goal for a later branch is to have an XSLT 1.0 version to put on a website, where you can generate a lilypond representation of a MEI edition on the fly.
